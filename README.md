# ShutupToys
WoW Addon to disable chatbubbles for most toys.

ShutupToys will hide the chat bubbles for many toys such as:

- Transmorpher Beacon
- Krastinov's Bag of Horrors
- Mr. Smite's brass Compass
- Gamon's Braid

It will then change back to whatever your default was.

A small caveat: You will be unable to change the chat bubble config in the interface pannel. Instead you can do "/st toggle", and it will save upon logout.
